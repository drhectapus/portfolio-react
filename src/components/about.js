        <p>Hi. I'm currently a Master's student in Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Previously, I completed medical school at Imperial College in London and practiced as a doctor for a few years afterwards.</p>
        <p>Along the way, I've also formulated dozens of supplements, interned at a few health tech startups, created an Amazon business and even worked as a cook at one point!</p>
        <p>What unites my previous experiences is a love for making things. Especially things that can have great impact.</p>
